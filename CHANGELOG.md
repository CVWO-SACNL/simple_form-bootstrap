## 1.1.0

### enhancements
  * There is no longer a need to retain a Simple Form initialiser, as well as a Simple 
  Form-Bootstrap initialiser. Just call `SimpleForm::setup` and the Bootstrap defaults would be 
  automatically applied. [@lowjoel](https://github.com/lowjoel)

  * Started writing specs and running them on Travis!
